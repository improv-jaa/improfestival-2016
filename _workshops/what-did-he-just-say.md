How often have we seen and done a scene where people just talk, talk, talk, often without listening and missing important details and subtext.
This workshop will teach you to focus on what your scene partner is saying, to listen and to react. To say yes.

Your scenes will be more dynamic and grounded, slower-paced and believable.

_Ando has studied improv for the past five years in international festivals and UCB courses. He enjoys teaching and performing grounded long-form improv._

**This is not an actual workshop taught @ Tilt. It's here for testing the online payment/billing system only.**
