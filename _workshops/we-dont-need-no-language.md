*We don't need no words to talk.*<br><br>

Language of improv is universal. No matter where we come from or how we we’re trained, we know about failing, being positive, connecting with our partners. The more we've internalised these concepts, the easier it becomes to step on stage with someone we've never met before. The language of improv is universal - our native languages, however, are not. Even though we have so many ways of navigating a scene, we still tend to use words as our number one tool. Time to make some changes!<br>
In this workshop, Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té will introduce you to some of the core principles of Commedia del Arte in order to bring more physicality into our performances. We will look at how movement and facial expression can add value to our scenework. We will play around with language and experience how we can push a story forward by only speaking Gibberish. We will stop intellectualizing and start exploring another facet of our universal language: no language at all!<br><br>

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.
