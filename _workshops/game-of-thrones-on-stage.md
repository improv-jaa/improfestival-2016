*Sex and Death, what more could you want from a workshop?*<br><br>

Whether you are a fan of the series and books or have no idea what a Warden, a Wight or a White Walker is, this workshop is a fun jousting romp in the medieval fantasy world. In this workshop the characters, stories and language of the genre are explored. Group scenes, fight choreography and dramatic monologues all will be used to create a fully improvised episode of this epic fantasy world. The skills learned in this workshop can be used as ongoing genre work or directly taken to the stage for an exciting show where sex, death and power rule the day.<br><br>

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.
