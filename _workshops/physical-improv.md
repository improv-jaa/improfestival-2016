*Pushups for Improvisers*<br><br>

Let's focus on improv using the body, which will amplify the fantastic language improv we all know and love. Or maybe we don't even need text anymore. The workshop is based on Dr. Ira Seidensteins own method (performed with Slava's Snow Show, Cirque Du Soleil, www.iraseid.com). It will provide lots of creative exercises to feed the physical side of improv that is often forgotten.<br><br>

Perfect for: intermediate and advanced improvisers and all entertainers who use their body (in dancing, classical theatre, circus, etc.).
