*"You say so much, when you say nothing at all."*<br><br>

Most of the time we use too much words when improvising. This workshop concentrates on creating and maintaining a deep and meaningful relationship between improvisers mostly without verbal connection. We will work on the intention over words and examine how this will give the audience the chance to be active members of storytelling. The more you give the more you get and by devoting to this work you will get a feel of how and why to use less words.<br><br>

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.
