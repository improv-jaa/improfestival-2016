*Fail Successfully*<br><br>

In this workshop we explore how to manage failure, and our fear of failure, how to support each other, and how to foster a spirit of trust. We will spend a lot of time focusing on our own behavior both on stage and off stage. We cannot create good theater without a large dose of personal commitment.<br><br>

Perfect for: beginning, intermediate and advanced improvisers.
