*Unpretentious entertainment for childish adults.*<br><br>

Scent ID, from Sweden, performs a show that is all about human relationships. Whether dysfunctional, functional, neurotic, or erotic, the show is usually funny, occasionally serious, and always entertaining. The ensemble makes a point of hanging out with the audience before shows, talking to them, asking questions, chatting. Sometimes they offer sweets as an icebreaker. They use this interaction instead of the usual audience suggestions as inspiration for their show.<br>
Cast: Kristin Augutis, Daniel Malmqvist, Peter Nordstrand, and maybe a guest.

This Swedish trio of fun loving actors are travelling together to get inspired by the world of improvisation. Maybe, if they are lucky, someone will get a little bit inspired by them.<br>
