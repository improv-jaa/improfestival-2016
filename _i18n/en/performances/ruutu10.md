*What the media is not telling you.*<br><br>

Newspapers that cover daily news often stay silent about different things. What really happened? What were the real influences and consequences of the event? Who was responsible of it? Who to thank or curse? What happens next? What should be taken into consideration now? With the help of improvising news team of Ruutu10 the news will be uncovered for the audience thoroughly and truthfully without being afraid of the real truth.
