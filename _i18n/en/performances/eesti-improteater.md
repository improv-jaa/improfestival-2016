*Heartbreaking topics and dramatic moments. These are the songs you can’t download from anywhere..*<br><br>

Eesti Improteater will step in front of the audience in a demanding genre that combines improvising in theatre and music. There are three-four professional singers among them and two amateur soloists so they are in competition even with each other for who sings the best song. The most important choices will still be left for the audience - whose turn it is to make a solo appearance with a song or which topic deserves most to be explored in this attractive genre. <br>
On the stage the main cast of Eesti Improteater: Kristel Aaslaid, Rednar Annus, Mart Gabrel, Kaia Oidekivi, Indrek Tamm, Sulev Võrno and guests.
