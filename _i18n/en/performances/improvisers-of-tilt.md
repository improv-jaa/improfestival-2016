*We don't need no words to talk.*<br><br>

What if you would experience an imaginary language that is created and crafted on the spot?<br>
What if this same language would be one of a kind that you would totally understand?<br>
That's what Grommelot is all about.<br>
Telling stories through languages that don't exist.

The fourth international improv festival Tilt is very proud to welcome improvisers from countries nearby and far away. Because these participants are very skillful improvisers, they are happy to engage also in challenges that are bigger than just improvising a performance on the spot! The same morning brave improvisers form different groups have met in the workshop of an improviser from the Réunion island Keng-Sam Chane Chick Té, with whom they have prepared the format that you will see in the evening. How will it all turn out - come see at the performance!
