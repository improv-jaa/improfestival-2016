*Secrets in the spotlight.*<br><br>

We all have our little secrets. The Improbanden love to play with mystery and to get inspired by the unspoken. You'll have the possibility to share your personal story by writing it down anonymously before the show starts. Their play will be inspired by your confession and they'll create weird, romantic, touching and crazy stories out of it. Everything is possible - but one thing is for sure: you'll never know who wrote down the secret...

The Improbanden has been performing short- and longforms in Berlin, Germany since 2011. Nine fellows laugh, cry and sing on and offstage. They operate their own improv school in Berlin and have been playing in several national and international festivals.<br>
