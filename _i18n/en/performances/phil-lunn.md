*A singer and her songs, unique for one evening.*<br><br>

An evening with a lady who isn't to be forgotten. Phil Lunn is a cabaret singer created for this one performance. Entirely improvised songs and entirely improvised conversation, all inspired by the audience.<br><br>
"A powerhouse of musical improv" — Open Your Mouth And Sing<br>
"My jaw wouldn't leave the floor. Loved every single minute" — Swimp16<br>
"A f***ing national treasure"—a nice person on Twitter<br>
