*One song and a collage of performing arts - that will take you... yes, even there!*<br><br>

The Collage combines different art forms into one complete improv long-form show. Inspiration is taken from music, films, TV shows, games and theatre.<br>
Imagine yourself watching a TV-series.... but... you then choose a song blindly from the choice of four differerent songs, which will be performed live and that will inspire the whole show.
