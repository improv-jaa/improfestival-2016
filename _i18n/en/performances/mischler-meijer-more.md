*Travelling back in time to return to the future makes this present show the place and the time to be. Don't miss it!*<br><br>

Combining the genre smarts of Mischler & More and the freewheeling style of Dizzy, Mischler, Meijer & More bring you "Return to the Present", an improvised Time Travel film inspired by the legendary film trilogy Back to the Future and other time travel movies. Time travel was never more fun as we explore paradox, the future, present and the past. Internet, anyone? Cellphones? Hoverboard parking at owners own risk.
