Maria likes to try new things. So it is only logical that next to 
having a thousand different hobbies, she finally ended up doing improv.

After trying it once, she was hooked. Having participated in Tilt for 
two years as a performer and an audience member, she could not sit 
still any more and wanted to be a part of the magic of organising the 
festival.

But a well-known secret is that the true love of Maria is food. 
This means she is the one to make sure that the team and the performers 
will never suffer from hunger.
