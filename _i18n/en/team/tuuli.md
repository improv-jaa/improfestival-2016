Tuuli has been a part of the Tilt audience for years, but this year she 
has decided to step behind the curtains. She is not keen to take the stage, 
but is contributing in every other way possible to the festivalâ€™s success. 
Tuuli has been working in event organization since 2011 focusing mainly on 
academic conference and major events. At the moment she is working as a project
 manager and is studying the same profession in university. During free time 
 one is most likely to find Tuuli in the forest or the kitchen.
